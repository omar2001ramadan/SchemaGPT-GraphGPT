FACTUAL BACKGROUND 

Defendant Christopher Bouzy (“Bouzy”) is the founder and CEO of Bot Sentinel, INC. 
Botsentinel.com describes the following “In 2018, Christopher Bouzy (@cbouzy) launched Bot 
Sentinel to help fight disinformation and targeted harassment. We believe Twitter users should 
be able to engage in healthy online discourse without inauthentic accounts, toxic trolls, foreign 
countries, and organized groups manipulating the conversation.” Bot Sentinel purports to be a 
benevolent site that is free to use and is financially supported by donations from magnanimous 
users. In fact, there is no artificial intelligence or machine learning behind Bot Sentinel. It is 
merely a façade. Bot Sentinel is a money raising scam intended to build Bouzy’s credibility

Case 1:21-cv-10878-AT Document 1 Filed 12/19/21 Page 3 of 11 

while it hides his true purpose to defame and attack users on Twitter he or his clients dislike. 
Bouzy uses the techniques he claims to monitor on Twitter to attack individuals and launch 
vicious personally damaging harassment, defamation, and reputation destruction campaigns. Bot 
Sentinel and Bouzy are engaged in a harassment for hire business model, and they serve clients 
who call on them to do so. In or around Decmber 2020, an individual named Benjamin Wittes 
(“Wittes”) agreed to engage in a text-based interview with the Plaintiff over Twitter. These 
exchanges are commonly referred to as “Ask Me Anything” or simply AMA sessions. Although 
Wittes agreed to participate voluntarily, he avoided answering uncomfortable questions and 
prematurely terminated the session when the Plaintiff raised evidence pertaining to a story that 
had been previously covered on Wittes podcast and blog titled Lawfare. Wittes departure from 
the online conversation was directly coincident with unwanted and insulting Twitter 
communications from Defendant Bouzy. Prior to this interaction, the Plaintiff had never met 
Bouzy and was totally unaware of him. Bouzy’s messages were filled with false claims so 
offensive and insulting, they prompted Plaintiff to search the internet for Bouzy’s phone number. 
After a lengthy phone call, Bouzy began a days long Twitter defamation campaign against 
Plaintiff that included false, baseless, and unsubstantiated claims made by Bouzy alleging that 
Plaintiff had committed the crime of rape. These heinous allegations are inherently damaging, 
false and were clearly made with the sole intention of injuring Plaintiff’s reputation and business. 
Not satisfied with mere reputation destruction, Bouzy took further steps to destroy the social 
media accounts that he knew were critical to Plaintiff’s daily business operations. Despite these 
horrendous actions, and due to Plaintiff demanding schedule, Plaintiff decided to ignore Bouzy 
and put the harassment, defamation, and tortious interference out of mind. Almost one year 
later, with no further provocation from Plaintiff, on December 17, 2021, Bouzy republished the 

COMPLAINT FOR ABUSE OF PROCESS AND MISCONDUCT BY ATTORNEYS -3 


Case 1:21-cv-10878-AT Document 1 Filed 12/19/21 Page 4 of 11 

same series of defamatory tweets. While New York case law precedent has determined that 
mere republication of old claims is insufficient to extend the statute of limitations, Bouzy’s most 
recent originally published defamatory statement was made on December 20, 2020 making this 
filing timely today. 

DEFENDANTS AND THEIR WRONGFUL ACTS 

11. On or around December 2020, Defendant Bouzy published a series of defamatory and 
libelous statements solely intended to harm Plaintiff. 
12. On December 20, 2021, Bouzy published a tweet via his @cbouzy twitter account 
which stated “Jason Goodman, the man who falsely accused Wittes of being part of a 
murder cover up, and called my cell after finding my number on the internet, sent me 
a cease and desist in DM. Jason doesn't want me tweeting that he threatened me not 
to tweet about his rape allegations...” (EXHIBIT A) 
13. During a private phone call just prior to the Twitter attack, Bouzy arbitrarily 
suggested he could find a person online who had accused the Plaintiff of rape, even 
though no person has ever made such an accusation aside from false statements made 
without evidence by Webb. 
14. On or around May 2018, Webb published a video on YouTube that has since been 
deleted. In the video, Webb made the false allegation that the Plaintiff had raped then 
underage Somali fashion model Halima Aden (“Aden”) 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halima_Aden). 
15. Aden has since become world famous. She has become a fashion icon and a role 
model to young Muslim women around the world as the first supermodel to wear a 
hijab in the pages of Vouge, Sports Illustrated and other major publications.

Case 1:21-cv-10878-AT Document 1 Filed 12/19/21 Page 5 of 11 

16. Webb’s claims were baseless, false, unsubstantiated, and ridiculous on their face. 
Plaintiff has never raped any person or engaged in any violent crime. Plaintiff has 
never met Aden. Plaintiff has never been romantically linked to a supermodel. 
17. The allegations made by Plaintiff against Wittes are based in fact, supported by 
evidence and have not been denied by anyone. Despite Defendant’s definitive claim, 
Plaintiff’s allegations have not been proven false. Plaintiff is a documentary 
filmmaker and journalist whose reputation for truthfulness is inherently valuable. 
18. On or around December 17, 2021, coincident with a filing by Webb in Sweigert v 
CNN (See Case 2:20-cv-12933-GAD-KGA ECF No. 35) Bouzy republished his 2020 
defamatory statements intended to injure Plaintiff. 
19. Plaintiff has submitted an Amicus Curiae brief in Sweigert v CNN that alleges 
criminal activity on the part of Webb and others. (See Case 2:20-cv-12933-GADKGA 
ECF No. 20) 
20. On information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that Webb engaged Bouzy to harass and 
defame Plaintiff in retaliation for the Amicus filing and to deliberately harm Plaintiff. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 

21. Defendant Bouzy made a false statement of fact with the deliberate intent of harming 
Plaintiff. The statement amounts to per se libel because it accuses Plaintiff of a 
heinous crime and is inherently understood to damage his reputation and standing as a 
member of society. 
22. Defendant Bouzy published his false statement to third parties on December 20, 2020, 
making this pleading timely. 
COMPLAINT FOR ABUSE OF PROCESS AND MISCONDUCT BY ATTORNEYS -5 


Case 1:21-cv-10878-AT Document 1 Filed 12/19/21 Page 6 of 11 

23. Third party responses on Twitter indicate that many members of the public believed 
the defamatory statement and it generated public hatred toward Plaintiff. 
24. Defendant Bouzy admitted he used these false statements as part of an effort to 
destroy YouTube, Facebook and other social media accounts owned by Plaintiff. 
25. Defendant Bouzy did this because he knew Plaintiff relied on for these social media 
accounts for the operation of his business and to earn income. 
26. Defendant Bouzy coordinated and conspired directly with Defendant Webb, utilizing 
false and defamatory information originally published by Webb. Bouzy made no 
reference to the original publication but made his own new publication of unqualified 
false statements of fact. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
Defamation 

27. Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth in the 
preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein.

Case 1:21-cv-10878-AT Document 1 Filed 12/19/21 Page 7 of 11 

33. These statements were made to others and for public consumption on the social 
media microblogging platform Twitter. 
34. Members of the public including thousands of Defendants’ Twitter followers and 
dozens of commenters saw, read and acknowledged or responded to Defendants’ false 
and defamatory statements. 
35. As a direct result of these malicious false statements, Plaintiff suffered harm to his 
reputation, career opportunities and income in an amount to be determined at trial.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays the Court will enter judgement in his favor for the 
following relief: 

1. Declaring that the Defendants statements were libelous and defamatory. 
2. For money damages for all economic losses including, but not limited to, 
lost, past and future earnings; and for compensatory damages; and for punitive 
damages; and for interest at the maximum legal rate on all sums awarded; and for

Until creepy Jason Goodman called me, I had no clue someone previously 
accused him of rape, and it's a bizarre thing to tell a stranger in a phone 
call. It's also odd to tell someone they would be part of ongoing litigation if 
they tweeted about it. Why bring it up?...
