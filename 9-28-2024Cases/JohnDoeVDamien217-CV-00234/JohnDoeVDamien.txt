COMES NOW Plaintiff, John Doe, which by way of this verified complaint alleges that: 

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

1. Jurisdiction is conferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, in that there is complete diversity 
between the parties hereto. There is supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1367 to hear and determine Plaintiff’s state law claims because those claims are related to 
Plaintiff’s federal claims, and arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts, and form 
part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. 
2. The Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s action for declaratory and injunctive relief 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 
3. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 et seq. because: (i) Defendants reside and/or 
conduct their business in this district; (ii) a substantial part of the events or omissions 
giving rise to the claim occurred in this district; or (iii) a substantial part of property that is 
the subject of this action is situated in this district. 


THE PARTIES 

4. Plaintiff John Doe (“Plaintiff”) is, and at all times mentioned herein was a resident in Los 
Angeles, California. 
5. Defendant Damien Vazquez (“Defendant”) is, and at all times mentioned herein was a 
resident of the State of New York. 
6. Plaintiff is informed and believes that all defendants, as agents of the other defendants, 
acting in concert with each other, have at all relevant times been in the entertainment 
business. On information and belief, defendants were the alter-egos of Defendant Vazquez, 
who at all times were acting within the scope of such alter-ego relationship, and actively 
participated in, or subsequently ratified and adopted, or both, each and all acts or conduct

alleged, with full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances, including, but not limited 
to, full knowledge of each and every violation of Plaintiff’s rights and the damages 
proximately caused thereby. 
7. Defendants and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, are sometimes individually and/or 
collectively referred to as Defendants. Plaintiff is ignorant of the true names and capacities 
of Defendants named in this action as Does 1 through 10 (collectively “Doe Defendants”) 
and they are therefore sued by such fictitious names. This complaint will be amended to 
allege their true names and capacities when they have been ascertained. Plaintiff is 
informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that such fictitiously-named defendants, 
and each of them, are responsible in some manner for the occurrences alleged, and that 
Plaintiff’s damages were proximately caused by their conduct. 


COMMON FACTS AND GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 

8. Plaintiff is a professional model and an actor. He has appeared in various shows and has 
numerous online followers on social media websites, including, but not limited to, 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and/or Snapchat. 
9. Defendant is active in the entertainment industry. Defendant owns and/or operates Loud 
Platinum, which on information and belief, provides custom promotional album plaques. 
10. On or about October 2015, Defendant reached out to Plaintiff, via Instagram, to initiate a 
friendship with him. 
11. The parties’ friendship started and ensued for several months. During the aforesaid 
friendship, on or around April 22, 2016, Plaintiff was invited to stay at Defendant’s 
residence, where unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Defendant surreptitiously took nude or semi-
nude photos of Plaintiff while he was sleeping. Plaintiff was not aware of Defendant’s 
actions. Plaintiff did not learn of the taking of the nude or semi-nude photos until

Defendant shared them with Plaintiff’s friends, colleagues, and/or relatives. On 
information and belief, Defendant took the nude or semi-nude photos to feel close to 
Plaintiff and to use them for personal gratification or to gain an advantage over him. 
12. On or about May 10, 2016, Defendant texted the nude or semi-nude photos to Plaintiff and 
his relatives (e.g., Plaintiff’s mother) with the threat of dissemination on social media 
websites and towards third parties. 
13. Around the same time, Defendant took Plaintiff’s mobile phone without Plaintiff’s 
authorization and extracted private pictures and videos that belonged to Plaintiff. For 
example, while in attendance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, 
California, Defendant surreptitiously extracted personal photos from Plaintiff’s cell phone 
since they were staying at same rental property. Afterwards, Defendant made numerous 
threats of dissemination of the nude or semi-nude photos unless Plaintiff kept his friendship 
intact with Defendant. 
14. On or about June 9, 2016, the nude or semi-nude photos were posted on social media 
websites (e.g., Twitter, Tumbler, Instagram). Moreover, on or about May 10, 2016, the 
nude or semi-nude photos were texted and emailed towards Plaintiff and electronically sent 
to third parties, such as Plaintiff’s mother, friends, and industry professionals. 
15. Therefore, as a result of the above-listed actions, Plaintiff indicated to Defendant that he no 
longer desired to remain friends with Defendant. However, Plaintiff’s request to end his 
friendship with Defendant did not sit well with Defendant. As stated herein, Defendant has 
failed or refused to leave Plaintiff alone. Thus far, Defendant has refused to accept the fact 
that Plaintiff does not wish to communicate with him under any circumstances. 
16. Nonetheless, due to Defendant’s insistence to continue the so-called friendship, Plaintiff 
gave in and tried to renew his friendship with Defendant. Their attempt to renew the so-

called friendship did not go well, which led to Defendant’s visit to Los Angeles, California, 
in order to meet with Plaintiff and try to restore the friendship. 
17. Defendant has been continuously contacting Plaintiff, his friends, colleagues, and/or 
relatives for the past several months in order to disrupt Plaintiff’s life and business 
relations. 
18. Despite Plaintiff’s appeals to Defendant to stop all communications through email, phone 
calls, and texting, Plaintiff has received continuous phone calls from “Unknown Caller ID” 
for several months. In addition, Defendant has used over 150 aliases to contact Plaintiff for 
no legitimate reason. 
19. Plaintiff, by using TrapCall (www.trapcall.com), has successfully captured and logged the 
unidentified phone calls that were received from the “Unknown Caller ID” and converted 
them to a known identification and phone number that directly associates with Defendant. 
20. In summary, for the past several months, Defendant has engaged in the following acts: 
1. Extracted private pictures from Plaintiff’s mobile phone without authorization; 
2. Took nude or semi-nude pictures of Plaintiff while Plaintiff was sleeping without 
consent. Defendant electronically distributed the aforesaid pictures to Plaintiff’s 
friends, colleagues, and/or relatives; 
3. Posted private nude or semi-nude pictures of Plaintiff on various social media websites 
(e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr); 
4. Contacted Plaintiff’s modeling/acting agents and industry professionals to ruin his 
business relationships; 
5. Contacted Plaintiff’s mother and current/former friends to damage his reputation; 
6. Spoofed mobile numbers in order to contact third parties, including, but not limited to, 
Plaintiff’s friends, colleagues, and/or relatives; 
7. Disrupted Plaintiff’s professional efforts in Tokyo, Japan by continuing to harass 
Plaintiff without justification; 
8. Remitted or attempted to remit funds towards Plaintiff’s friends to divulge Plaintiff’s 
personal information, including, but not limited to, his phone number; 
9. Reached out to Plaintiff’s fans in an effort to ruin his reputation; and 
10. Continuously called Plaintiff’s mobile phone (i.e., 500+ calls per day), so that 
Plaintiff’s mobile phone cannot be used for legitimate purposes.

21. On or about May 13, 2016, Defendant contacted Plaintiff’s modeling agents via Twitter at 
(@IMGmodels, @NeXTModels) and stated that: “Keep checking my page for those leaked 
Cody nudes!” 
22. On or about May 13, 2016, Defendant contacted Plaintiff’s business colleagues 
(@ComicConHouston) via Twitter and stated that: “Keep checking my page for those 
leaked Cody nudes!” 
23. On or about May 22, 2016, Defendant contacted Plaintiff’s friend and stated that: “$1,000 
electronic payment made through www.venmo.com for Plaintiff’s phone number.” 
24. On or about October 1, 2016, Defendant contacted Plaintiff’s manager, via Instagram, and 
stated that: “Your client needs saving.” 
25. From March 2016 until the present time, despite Plaintiff’s numerous attempts to end his 
friendship with Defendant, which has been unsuccessful so far, Plaintiff and his mother 
have been compelled to change their telephone number several times. 
26. On information and belief, Defendant is gaining access to Plaintiff and his mother’s mobile 
phone numbers as soon as their mobile phone numbers are cancelled, revoked, or changed 
in order to avoid receiving repeated calls from Defendant. In fact, on or about December 
15, 2016, Defendant used Plaintiff’s mother’s latest work phone number to attempt to reach 
Plaintiff. 
27. Defendant is under the impression that Plaintiff owes him an apology. Defendant has 
asked Plaintiff to apologize for his actions, and in return, Plaintiff has apologized towards 
Defendant to resolve their differences. Nevertheless, it seems that Defendant cannot be 
reasonably satisfied with any apology. At times, Defendant’s contentions are about trying 
to save Plaintiff from himself. In other instances, Defendant contends that Defendant and 
his mother have been wronged and there must be retribution.

28. Plaintiff has desperately tried to resolve the issues that Defendant may have with him. In 
fact, despite Plaintiff’s numerous attempts to apologize and terminate the so-called 
friendship with Defendant, Plaintiff is still receiving numerous phone calls and/or text 
messages from Defendant. 
29. On or about November 21, 2016, the parties negotiated, and ultimately executed a 
settlement and mutual release agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) in an effort to resolve 
the issues and avoid litigation. Therein, among other items, the parties agreed to leave each 
other alone and to never contact each other. However, from the above-listed date until the 
present time, Defendant has failed or refused to comply with the terms of the Settlement 
Agreement. 
30. Defendant continuously checks Plaintiff’s social media accounts on (e.g., @codysaintnew, 
@cody_saintgnuer, @SaintgnueBrasil, @ddiivergent) to determine when, where, how, or 
why Plaintiff is working on various business projects. 
31. Defendant’s actions have caused business interruptions. For example, Plaintiff’s agent was 
prevented from contacting Plaintiff by telephone for days, due to Defendant’s continuous 
and uninterrupted phone calls, to inform Plaintiff that he had a feature film movie offer to 
be shot the next day. 
32. Plaintiff was in a business relationship with MTV Networks and Bravo Models. Defendant 
knew about these business relations since Defendant follows Plaintiff on social media 
websites, and as a result, would have seen Plaintiff’s online postings. In fact, Defendant 
sent a message from PlatinumKid44 @gmail.com towards Plaintiff and threatened to 
prevent Plaintiff’s opportunity of getting on the final season of “Teen Wolf” even if it is for 
two minutes. 
33. Defendant has used the following email addresses to alarm, annoy, or harass Plaintiff or his

DollarDameDoller@aol.com; (6) Platinumkid1444@gmail.com; and (7) 
damedoller@aol.com. 
34. Also, Defendant has used the following telephone numbers to alarm, annoy, or harass 
Plaintiff or his immediate family: (1) 917-597-5622; (2) 320-435-6727; (3) 310-435-6727; 
(4) 818-569-9062; (5) 347-586-5852; (6) 252-517-3289; (7) 484-388-5390; (8) 704-440-
0790; (9) 240-776-8586; and (10) 714-408-9384. 
35. Defendant’s continuous and uninterrupted phone calls have rendered Plaintiff’s cell phone 
practically unusable for normal business operations. In fact, MTV Networks cancelled its 
offer to Plaintiff to appear in a promotional taping of “Teen Wolf” that was to be filmed 
from November 11-14, 2016, due to the studio’s inability to connect with Plaintiff through 
his cell phone since it was always busy and made Plaintiff appear inaccessible. 
36. Defendant’s actions directly impacted Bravo Models’ desire and ability to line up modeling 
appointments for Plaintiff. As such, Plaintiff was forced to return home in order to address 
the situation and was compelled to terminate his business relationships with Bravo Models. 
37. Based on the foregoing, an actual controversy has arisen, and now exists, between Plaintiff 
and Defendant concerning their respective rights and duties. As such, a judicial declaration 
is necessary and appropriate at this time in order for the parties to ascertain their rights and 
duties pursuant to applicable laws. 


FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
Invasion of Privacy 

(Against All Defendants) 

 

38. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 37 as though fully 


 set forth herein.

25 

26 

27 

28 

39. Defendant invaded Plaintiff’s privacy by taking nude or semi-nude pictures without 
Plaintiff’s authorization. Defendant invaded Plaintiff’s privacy by accessing his electronic 
devices without authorization. As such, Defendant’s transgressions constitute invasion of 
privacy due to the above-listed intrusions upon seclusion and/or publications of private 
facts. 
40. Defendant intruded into Plaintiff’s private place, conversation, or matter in a manner that 
was highly offensive to Plaintiff. 
41. Defendant publicly disclosed private facts that were offensive and objectionable to Plaintiff 
and not related to any legitimate public concern. 
42. Plaintiff’s privacy rights are protected by federal common law, federal public policy, 
federal statutory law, the federal Constitution, as well as California state common law, 
California state public policy, California state statutory law, and the California state 
Constitution. 
43. As stated hereinabove, these invasions were highly offensive towards Plaintiff. Moreover, 
the invasions would be highly offensive to any reasonable person. 
44. Therefore, Plaintiff has been generally damaged in an amount within the jurisdictional 
limits of this court. 


SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
Civil Harassment In Violation of C.C.P. § 527.6 

(Against All Defendants) 

 

45. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 44 as though fully 
set forth herein. 
46. Defendant’s wrongful conduct, as alleged hereinabove, though not threatening violence, 
nevertheless was “a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person 
that seriously alarms, annoys, or harasses the person, and that serves no legitimate

28 

purpose.” As such, such misconduct constitutes civil harassment, under C.C.P. § 527.6(b), 
as well as, misdemeanor crime, under Penal Code §§ 653m and 653.2. Stated otherwise, 
the “course of conduct [was] such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial 
emotional distress, and [did] actually cause substantial emotional distress to [Plaintiff]” as 
required by C.C.P. § 527.6(b). 
47. As alleged herein, Plaintiff did suffer severe emotional distress as a direct consequence of 
Defendant’s harassment. 
48. As a direct and proximate consequence of Defendant’s harassment alleged herein, Plaintiff 
has been generally, specially, and consequentially damaged in the amount to be established 
according to evidence. 
49. Under C.C.P. § 527.6(r), Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees that he incurs to 
prosecute an action seeking an injunction pursuant to C.C.P. § 527.6. 
50. The civil harassment was committed willfully and intentionally, and by means of 
oppression, fraud, and malice, and in conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights. Therefore, 
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of exemplary or punitive damages under Civil Code § 3294, 
in an amount to be established at trial, in order to meaningfully punish Defendant, and to 
thereby deter similar conduct in the future. Punitive damages are especially appropriate 
because of Defendant’s past pattern of oppressive and harassing conduct. 
51. Defendant’s harassment alleged herein, unless enjoined by a preliminary injunction order 
and a permanent injunction judgment of this court (or in the alternative, statutory 
temporary restraining order and three-year injunction under C.C.P. § 527.6) will continue 
to cause great and irreparable injury to Plaintiff. As such, Plaintiff has no adequate remedy 
at law for injuries that he is currently suffering, and are threatened to be suffered from 
Defendant’s harassment and illegal conduct.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
Civil Stalking In Violation of Civil Code § 1708.7 Et Seq. 

(Against All Defendants) 

52. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 51 as though fully 
set forth herein. 
53. Defendant engaged in conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time, however 
short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. 
54. Plaintiff reasonably feared for his safety, or the safety of an immediate family member. 
55. Plaintiff suffered substantial emotional distress, and the pattern of conduct would cause a 
reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress. 
56. Defendant, as a part of his pattern of conduct, made a credible threat with the intent to 
place Plaintiff in reasonable fear for his safety, or the safety of an immediate family 
member, which was in violation of, inter alia, Penal Code §§ 422, 646.9, and 653. 
57. Defendant, as part of his pattern of conduct, made a credible threat with reckless disregard 
for the safety of Plaintiff or that of an immediate family member. Plaintiff, on at least one 
occasion, clearly and definitively demanded that Defendant ceases and abates his pattern of 
conduct. However, Defendant persisted in his pattern of conduct. 


FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
Cyber Exploitation In Violation of Civil Code § 1708.85 Et Seq. 

(Against All Defendants) 


58. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 57 as though fully 
set forth herein. 
59. Defendant intentionally distributed photographs, films, videotapes, recordings, or other 
reproductions of Plaintiff without his consent. 
60. Defendant knew that Plaintiff had a reasonable expectation that the aforesaid material 
would remain private. Plaintiff did not waive his reasonable expectation of privacy in the
