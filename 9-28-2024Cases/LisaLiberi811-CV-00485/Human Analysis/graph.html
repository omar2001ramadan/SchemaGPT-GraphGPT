Currently, as this was uncovered, she created new web sites Defend our freedoms. org, . net and continues the scheme by making those sites similar to myoid ones and using the foundation name to steal more donations. She created a visa donation site with her e-mail account Go Excell Global, underneath she posted a PayPal button showing my foundation Defend Our Freedoms (without my consent) and my e-mail address (without my consent) to look as if she is still connected to me and my foundation. even though all ties with her were severed a couple of weeks ago, when I found out about this scheme and I closed the Pay Pal account completely. Any person, whose donations were stolen by Lisa Ostella aka Lisa Current aka Calpernia is asked to report this to his local police or sheriff\u0027s department. As I found out, she appears to be connected to Lisa Liberi, who is still working for attorney Phillip Berg. Please see my dossier #6, Lisa Liberi aka Lisa Richardson aka Lisa Courvelle has a long criminal record, that includes grand theft, forgery of documents, forgery of seal, falsification of police reports and credit statements, where financial institutions were defrauded out of thousands of dollars.

I cannot abide the lies, false accusations and trashing of me when I discovered some less than honest dealings were going on. One lie after another has been told to me and about me! I have given this cause and Phil everything in my being since last July, when my research really began in June. Maybe in a few days I will be able to talk about if, but my stomach is churning tonight and I am heartbroken at the betrayal of me after a 10 + year friendship was ended tonight, where Phil was not even willing to listen to me or even tell me what it is I am supposed to have done, this time. I will try to make a more complete statement in a day or two. I am certain that Barry Soetoro is not a US citizen, but we need people with more integrity to pursue this cause.

Mortgage Fraud Blog -New Mexico Woman Sentenced in Identity Theft and_Real El\u003etate Frqud Thursday, April 10, 2008 New Mexico Woman Sentenced in Identity Theft and Real Estate Fraud lisa Uberit aka lisa Richardson, 42, New Mexico, was sentenced in connection with felony charges involving identity theft and forged documents. Liberi appeared in San Bernardino County, Rancho Cucamonga, Superior Court, on March 21, 2008. She was sentenced to a state prison term of 8 years, imposed but stayed, and placed on supervised probation for 3 years as part of a plea agreement. Uberi was sentenced on ten felony counts ranging from Grand Theft, Forgery, and Filing False Documents. From 2000 to 2004, liberi engaged in a complex fraud involving falsification of police reports, manipulation of credit bureau reports, loan fraud, and counterfeiting of court documents resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses to banks and credit unions. In 2002, San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department personnel arrested Uberi on theft by false pretense charges. In July 2004, Investigators from the San Bernardino County District Attorney\u0027s Real Estate Fraud Unit arrested Uberi at the Ontario International Airport for additional felony charges while she was out on bail.

ObamaCitizenshipDebate. com To: newwomensparty@yahoogrouPS.COIll Date: Wednesday, March 18, 2009, 6: 45 PM As you\u0027ve probably noticed, there have been changes to the OC Board discussions lately. Everything from additional Agents, to subtraction of Agents and members, to Obots being allowed back to the board and to be placed into positions of trust as Moderators/Agents. A lot has been going on behind the scenes, as well as on the OC board itself. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re not happy with what\u0027s going on. We aren\u0027t, either. It\u0027s counter productive to having discussions, when you\u0027re busy rehashing 6 month-old arguments with people who are purposely derailing every discussion. So a group of us got together, including former Moderators/ Agents, and decided it was time to do our own thing. We\u0027ve decided to create our own board. It will be an atmosphere that is Obot-FREE. Our core group want nothing more than Justice for the usurper in our Office. We can have flowing discussion, like we had before the changes at OC. Also, there may be some pleasant surprises in store, on the new board. Surprises that will definitely be a HUGE benefit for this cause. We aren\u0027t limiting ourselves to discussions of anyone attorney or effort. We want to raise public awareness of all the efforts to expose the truth and remove the Usurper from office. We\u0027d like to have you join us at our new site, if you are interested in truth and justice. Please invite others to join, but only invite those who you\u0027re SURE are with US, not THEM. This will ensure progress in our daily discussions. We are implementing a screening process to insure only like minded individuals are accepted into our ranks. Welcome to our friends. Thanks. The Administration Team at ObamaCitizenshipDebate oflnda Starr: JQunler, new Womeru pari\" Feminism: (noun) the radical notion that women are people. Well behaved women seldom make history! to Lisa Liberi date Mar 20, 20099: 48 PM subject mailed-by Lisa, below is the e-mail Linda sent to Amboy Duke, the guy she thinks is Ted Nudgent. Amboy Duke is not Ted Nugent but someone from another blog. Thank you for responding. I am glad to hear from you again. I was beginning to think you got frustrated and quit. I have a new effort and site that is very exciting to a lot of people who are following me, having gotten disgusted with Phil. We just got the new site up and plan to raise public awareness for all the cases. This way I have not publicly gone against Phil, whose efforts I truly do not want to harm, or diminish his chances to win any of his cases. He deserves credit for all his hard work when he was the only one willing to take action and the first to file suit. He has worked tirelessly, but unfortunately, he won\u0027t win because there is a serious problem with Lisa and Barry\u0027s people are going to hurl it out in the court and that\u0027ll be it for all the cases. Berg supporters know something very bad happened to make me leave (which it did), but I do not intend to make it a public issue. Many of them did and a lot of people left and convinced me to do my own campaign and are following me now. It\u0027s because I was accused of terrible things by Lisa that are simply not true and I defended myself, but only with a handful of people. Phil believed her and I was forced out. Then he wrote me another nasty e-mail basically trying to intimidate me into silence about Lisa, which wasn\u0027t necessary because I wasn\u0027t the one who exposed her issues as I was accused of doing. I didn\u0027t even know it, but she has some major credibility problems that I don\u0027t want to get into. We believe our time is better spent raising public awareness for the efforts of everyone. Phil shouldn\u0027t be slamming Orly Taitz just because she\u0027s making a lot of noise and getting a lot of attention. I told him not to be slamming her, but now that I\u0027m forced out, he is listening to Lisa. It looks like sour grapes. My role was both cheerleader and attack dog since I could do that as a volunteer. Lisa has allowed trolls to take over and even become moderators. I don\u0027t know if she\u0027s getting blackmailed by them or what, but it\u0027s a very toxic environment and people just don\u0027t want to be there, and that includes financial supporters who wonder now how their donations have been spent. It got so bad that you saw the results when you kept asking questions. And it\u0027s was never that way before. Posters welcomed the chance to answer questions. My site will be like that and we will have a section that isn\u0027t up yet, to list the facts and answer most of the pertinent questions. You will be able to go to one place and get answers without having to sort through 1000\u0027s of blogger posts. I used to be a guest on a lot of radio shows talking about my findings exposing various scandals and crimes. I am going to start doing that again to reach a larger audience. Me and the others who came with me to start this new effort feel that if we can raise the public awareness to a level that 100 million people are demanding Barry produce the proof, or that the DOJ arrest and remove him to prosecute for all his many crimes in illegally usurping office as POTUS. My efforts will not conflict with Phil\u0027s, but I feel compelled to say, please don\u0027t get involved with him. I no longer trust Phil or his Judgment after he was willing to listen to outright lies about me made by Lisa. You don\u0027t throw someone under the bus after being friends for more than 10 years, especially not your main cheerleader who fires people up to support the cause. Like I said before, this is no catfight. It\u0027s a major integrity issue. Lisa is a pathological liar and it really pains me to say that, but it\u0027s true. I can\u0027t, in good conscience, possibly recommend you get involved with Phil after what I learned. I don\u0027t want to say more in writing. In answer to your second e-mail, no one contacted me on your behalf. And if someone does, I will answer their questions in detail. I have enough knowledge to do that and speak coherently on the subject. In fact, I have been dOing that all along except for a few legal questions. Now I know the answers so we don\u0027t necessarily need anyone else to answer. I am raising funds to wage a media campaign to raise public awareness, buying media ads and such. And if you decide to help us, you will know exactly what we are doing. My site is moving to another server today that is a better place for our bloggers and security. My site is going to be bigger than Phil\u0027s because a lot of the supporters who had another favorite and scattered when their efforts failed, will join me and we\u0027ll support them ALL I look forward to speaking to you or someone on your behalf soon.
