IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO ORLY TAITZ alkla 
DR. ORLY TAlTZ alkla LAW OFFICES OF ORLY TAITZ alkla 
WWW.ORLYTAITZESQ.COM alkla WWW.REPlJBX.COM alkla 
ORLY TAITZ, INC., DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS FOUNDATION, 
INC. and YOSEF TAITZ 


25. 1n or about November 2008, the name orty Taitz appeared as filing legal 
complaints in Sacramento, California on behalf of Alan Keyes and other Plaintiffs 
and against the Calitornia Secretary of State and other Defendants regarding the 
Ban'y Soetoro a/k/a Barack H. Obama citizenship issues'. Ironically, Taitz 


I Ambassador Dr. A/an K!!J!gs. el al. v. Calif(mlia SecrelaT}, o(Stale Debra Bowen, et ai. Superior Court of the State 
of CaHfomia for the County of Sacramento, Case No. 34-2008-80000096-CU-WM-GDS, which was recently 
dismissed. 


plagiarized the work of Philip J. Berg, his Assistant Lisa and his law practice, Law 

Offices of Philip 1. Berg. 

26. Orly Taitz set up the business name of Defend our Freedoms Foundation, Inc. as a 
non-profit Organization with a Federal Tax Identification number of 26-4328440. 
However, when you attempt to verify the Federal Tax Identification number it comes 
back invali(f. 
27. Taitz had a website at drorly.blogspot.com, which did have some nefarious 
functions and Taitz authorized those functions. At this time, Ostella assumed it was 
because Taitz did not understand the internet. There was a third [3rd] party program 
added to drorly.blogspot.com. This program was collecting information from 
everyone who was visiting and posting at Taitz website (drorly.blogspot.com) and 
transferring the individuals' private data to an unknown server. Taitz was well aware 
of these functions as she authorized them and had the head web master install the 
software on December 24,2008. 
28. The data transfer took place via a java sctipt program plus a put command that 
enabled FTP transfer. The java program is what caused trouble with people using 
Taitz's website located at drorly.blogspot.com. Most computers are set up with 
security tirewalls that do not allow easy data collection. 
29. Ostella purchased and owned the defendourfreedoms. us and 
defendourfreedoms.org, web sites and she maintained them on the server that she 
(OsteIla) paid for. Ostella allowed Taitz to use said websites. Ostella supported Taitz 
and has always been involved with politics, campaigns and causes. So when Ostella 
saw the antics with the java script program on the other blog (drorly.blogspot.com), 


2 h\!P...:!1!y"'\ยฃ\'y~IDgIL~~~~t~!;,l,'<::91]!lQ.Q.~.IJQ~11Jl5J>.:2?jJ2~"2~:'..U_~8-=HCJ~~gIQmiJl=.Subml~ 


and it was never clear on how much Taitz realized was going on, Ostella took Taitz 

over here to use Ostella's accounts. All of the DefendOurFreedoms domain names 
were and are on Ostella's web accounts. 

30. DefendOurFreedoms.org, owned by Lisa Ostella was and is hosted at Ostel1a's 
server. It is a stand-alone server on rack rental at HE.Net. Ostella had and has full 
access to this server and no other accounts are on this server but hers. Ostella verified 
her IP lugs to ensure the website was not "hacked". The IP Address logs show every 
IP address, which is a computer's identification that entered the website and/or server. 
There has never been any other IP addresses that have appeared on the IP logs other 
than Ostella's. Hence, the website and/or server have never been "hacked". 
31. As for DetendOurFrecdoms.us, that was hosted at GoDaddy under Ostel1a's 
reseller account. This domain did not point to a website, it pointed to a blog. 
Specifically, it pointed to QuickBlogcast. This is very important to understand. A 
blog is not a website. The domain points to a database label. If the blog had been 
"hacked", someone would have had to break into GoDaddy's database files and know 
what customer number the database files was under. This would have compromised a 
number of other accounts with more damage other than a change in the e-mail 
address. GoDaddy would have had to issue a notification to all customers. Of 
course, GoDaddy never issued such a notification because the blog was never 
"hacked". 
32. None of the DefendOurFreedoms website were ever hacked or sabotaged, as Taitz 
claimed. Being unable to access a website due to network latency does not equal 



"hacking". Traffic, congestion, line repairs affect network flow and all can always be 

checked on the Internet Traffic RepOlt3. 

33. Another webmaster who goes by "creativeogre" and Ostella called Taitz and 
explained to Taitz her websites had never been hacked. 
34. On or about March 9, 2009, another issue arose with Taitz and her PayPal 
account. Taitz had volunteers with access to the coding of her PayPal account on her 
blogs. One of Taitz's volunteers or Taitz herself changed 1'aitz e-mail address 
associated with her PayPal account oriy.taitz(lzJ,gmail.com to 
oriy.taitz@gmail.org. 
35. Bob Stevens, Taitz's Head Webmaster created four [4] e-mail accounts for Taitz. 
Taitz was supplied all her e-mail accounts which included, amongst others, 
Qr.tall?c@grrmiL~om. Despite knowing this was her own e-mail address, Ta1tz sent a 
mass e-mailing out with the below statement and posted the statement on her website, 
knowing it to be false.

36. As a result, 1'aitz was not recelvmg her donations. Donations received were 
rejected by PayPal as the e-mail address was incorrect and no such e-mail address 

3 http://www.internettrafficreport.com 


existed. Since the e-mail address did not exist, PayPal rejected the donations and sent 

them back to the contributors. Hence. the donations were not stolen or misdirected as 
Taitz claimed, which Taitz was well aware. 

37. Despite the fact Taitz was well aware her websites and PayPal accounts had 
never been "hacked" or tampered with, 011 or about April 2. 2009, Taitz wrote to the 

U.S. Supreme COUl1 Justices4 seeking help in an investigation regarding a criminal 
complaint she had tiled with the Federal Bureau of Investigations regarding hacking 
into her websites and tampering of her PayPal accounts, and other things. Taitz sent 
this same letter to the Secret Service and other Governmental Law Enforcement 
Agencies. Taitz was aware the infornlation she gave to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigations was tillse and she was wen aware she was filing a false report. 

38. As a result of the false report made by Orly Taitz to the Federal Government, 
Ostella informed Taitz that she must clear up the false reports or Ostella was 
removing Taitz from her websites and server. Taitz refused to clear this matter up 
and refused to retract her falsified police reports. When Taitz refused to clear up this 
report, Ostella told Taitz she had to move her sites. Taitz asked Ostella to give her 
thil1y [30] days so she would be able to find a new host. 
39. Instead of Taitz locating a new server, she gave an interview to World Net Daili 


4th 

on April , 2009 elaborating on her scheme to mislead the public and law 

4:20 p.m. can be located at: h1trE(/defcndour.fi~~@,!!!;i.l1et!~J!09!04lQ'yJ;lJ?~J).:J!m"r~19-thc-w[eme-courtrequest-ofยฃ.

4 A copy of the letter Orly Taitz sent to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was posted by Orly Taitz on April 2. 2009 at 


enforcement into believing her wcbsitcs and PayPal accounts were "hacked" and 

"sabotaged". Again, Taitz was well aware none of these events took place. 

40. Although Ostella continued infonning and explaining to Taitz her websites had 
never been "hacked", Taitz continued to spread the falsified story. As a result, 
Ostella told Taitz she had to immediately move her sites. 
41. Taitz found a person by the name of Jesse Smith who was to be her new web host. 
She authorized Ostella to transfer the domains to him. Jesse Smith first contacted 
Ostella on April 9,2009. Ostella told him to initiate the transfer. Jesse Smith started 
the initiation on April 10, 2009 through Network Solutions. Ostella accepted the 
transfer request and the transfer process started. 
42. Now, remember, the site was not a wehsite. It is a blog. The domain pointed to a 
database label. Normally, when a domain is transfened from a website, the domain 
just switches from the one site to the new site smoothly. It will leave the old site still 
showing; but with the virtual host name. In order to move a blog site, which is a 
database, the account would delete when the transfer activates. To protect al1 the 
data, Ostella moved the account onto DefendOurFreedoms.Net, then unlocked the 
domain and authorized the transfer. For whatever reason, this outraged Taitz and 
Taitz accused Ostella of being defiant. 
43. On April 12, 2009, Taitz went on the Evil Conservative Blogcast6 and told the 
audience that Ostella had threatened her and altered the focus of her story onto the 
PayPalaccount. 




44. For protection purposes, Ostella locked the website access of all of her (Ostella's) 
websites. Ostella changed the PayPal script in the donations button to reflect her own 
account and removed Taitz's accounts from the site. Ostella placed notifications on 
all her webpages that the sites were no longer 1'aitz's Defend our Freedom 
Foundation, Inc. and Ostella posted the following links to ensure people understood 
1'aitz's sites were never"hacked".

hUn:!/clefcndollrfreeQor!l~J.et!20Q9I.Q1LL;;llwderstanding-the-intClllet-191.aspx 

45. Once Ostella posted the above, she received the following Ceizc [sic] and Desist 
from 1'aitz, which was untrue. Ostella at all times owned the domains and servers 
that the domains were located. 
"Ceize and Desist 

04.13.09. 
Ms. Ostella, 


This is a Ceize and Desist Letter, advising you to stop immediately 

operation of sites and shut down DefendOurFreedoms.net; 

DefendOurFreedoms.US; DefendOurFreedoms.Org, and 

DefendOurFreedoms.Com and any other relating sites that you have been 

operating after I requested transfer. You have used those sites for 

defamatory purpose of me and my foundation and you have used my 

hkeness and my material without my permission. If you do not shut down 

above sites immediately, fmiher actions wi11 be taken. 

Sincerely, 

Dr. Or1y 1'aitz Esq 

26302 La Paz ste 211 
Mission Viejo Ca 92691" 


46. Moreover, 1'aitz, placed JS Kit software which is a "tracking" and "hacking" 
software on her Defend our Freedoms Foundation, Inc. websites and blogs, this 
softwith the exception of the DefendourFreedoms websites owned by Lisa Ostella, in 


order to "track" and "hack" individuals and their computers who have visited her 

websites. Defendant Yosef has a server in Taitz, and his home in order to complete 
their illegal activities. 

47. Unfortunately, Liberi's computer was infected with Taitz's JS Kit Software and a 
remote server was placed on Liberi's home computer by accessing Taitz website. 
48. Taitz began changing her story to focus on "hacking" of her PayPal account, even 
though it never happened. Taitz was literally telling people that her PayPal account 
was "hacked", knowing this to be false. In fact, there is no way Taitz's PayPal 
account could have been hacked. PayPal's servers that hold individuals' private data 
are not connected directly to the internet. There are servers in between. So the server 
an individual logs into in order to access their PayPal account, is not the same server 
that houses the infomlation. If someone was able to break into that system, PayPal 
would have had to notify all customers of a breach and shut all processes down to 
investigate. Taitz literally had people thinking that her e-mail address was changed 
from within the PayPal account, again knowing this information to be false. 
49. Taitz never launched an investigation with PayPal in reference to her "hacking" 
allegations. Instead, Taitz made blatant statements saying money was stolen out of 
her account. Again, the entire time knowing this infonnation was false. 
50. Because of Taitz false statements regarding her PayPal account being "hacked", 
Ostella posted the following:

asPK 


51. The change was in the e-mail address on the blogsite. Originally, the PayPal 
donate code on the blogsite was in an encrypted script that PayPal makes available for 
copying and pasting into blogs and websites. But GoOaddy made some updates in 
the design in February 2009. The updates didn't function with the PayPal script 
encryption. See the below e-mail received from GoOaddy.

On February 11, 2009, Lisa, was advised that the PayPal button links do 
not work on the sidebar within the Quick Blogcast.

52. Taitz is no stranger to falsifying stories and falsely claiming to be the victim of 
"hacking" of her websites. On December 12, 2009 Taitz and Bob Stevens, Taitz 
Head Webmaster, began telling people that "Obama thugs" had her business/dental 
site, dnaii/"com. shut down. They wanted this infonnation immediately posted on the 
blogs. Ostella stopped the posting of this intonnation by looking up the domain and 
finding Taitz's prior host data. In short what Taitz had done was switched her own 
domain off the website. Taitz told Ostella she (Taitz) was signing up for a web tramc 
program. Taitz told Ostella she (Taitz) was going to give Ostella access to get her 
domain back and Ostella would be her new hired webmaster for Taitz's dental 
websites. Ostella was never given access. Taitz's dental websites are up and running 
and Ostella is unsure who Taitz's webmaster is. 
53. On April 12, 2009, Ostella received the following e-mail containing false and 
incomplete infonnation further slandering Ostella. This e-mail was sent to an 



unknown number of undisclosed recipients as well as carbon copied to Ostella and 

the Chicago FBI:

54. It was also discovered Taitz had authorized placement of JS Kit Software on all 
her Defend our Freedoms Foundation, Inc. websites and blogs. Again, this does not 
include the DefendourFrcedome websites owned and operated by Ostella. JS Kit 
software is tracking software used in "hacking" websites and personal computers. In 
the JS Kit software is a function that places remote servers on individual and 
company computer systems in order to allow the person using JS Kit software, in this 
case, Taitz, Yoself and other unknown individuals on their behalf to illegally enter the 
individuals and company computers to steal and transfer data. This remote server 
function was located on Liberi's computer. 
55. Yosef, Taitz husband and Taitz have implemented their own server in their home 
located in Laguna Niguel to utilize the "tracking" and "hacking" of individual and 
company computers who have visited Taitz websites and blogs. Yosef is assisting his

wife, and their companies, Orly Taitz. Inc., Defend our Freedoms Foundation, Inc., 
and Taitz, in her illegal activities. I-fence, it is not Plaintiffs Ostella or Liberi 
"hacking" Taitz andlor Defend our Freedoms Foundation, Inc. websites, blogs andlor 
PayPal accounts, it is Taitz, her husband Yosef and other unknown named individuals 
on their behalf who are "hacking" the computers of the Plaintiffs and other 
individuals and companies who have visited any oftheir websites andlor blogs. 

56. On or about April 12,2009, Berg received an e-mail from Taitz stating he was to 
"Ceize and Desist" [sic] from using Taitz's Quo Warranto, which Taitz claimed was 
sent to Berg inadvertently. In this same e-mail, Taitz made false allegations claiming 
his (Berg's) Paralegal, Lisa Liberi had an extensive criminal record involving 
amongst other things identity theft. Taitz went on further in her e-mail to Berg that 
Libert's husband was currently on parole and he had sct up two (2) accounts 
accepting credit cards on Berg's "charitable toundation", again all of which was 
falsified and fabricated by Taitz. Taitz in her e-mail stated as an officer of the Court 
she was obligated to send the information to the "FBI", Attorney General of 
California and San Bernardino County District Attorney since Lisa Liberi had an 
eight [8] year conviction in San Bernardino County, California. Taitz in her e-mail 
infonlled Berg that she believed that Berg, as an Officer of the Court, as well and a 
fonner Assistant Attorney General of Pennsylvania, should join her in issuing a joint 
Complaint and demand for investigation from the authorities. Taitz then forwarded 
the e-mail addressed to Berg to an undisclosed number of recipients. 
57. Liberi then received an e-mail from Mr. Hale claiming Lisa Liberi was stealing 
money from Taitz's PayPal account. Mr. Hale's e-mail was forwarding an e-mail 
sent out by mass mailing by Taitz stating, "/ also received information that her 



husband. "1'/10 is cllrrent(v on parole. is an owner of2 of'accolll1tS. accepting credit 

cards on your charitable foundation web site." At all times, Taitz and Mr. Hale were 

well aware this infonnation was false and untrue.

04.12.09. 
Mr. Phillip Berg, 


"this is to infOlID you that a few days ago I have forwarded my quo 

warranto pleadings to Mr. John Hemenway, since he agreed to be my local 

co-counsel in Washington DC. This was a confidential communication 

and Mr. Hemenway stated, that mistakenly he has forwarded those 

pleadings to you. Shortly thereafter you have sent a press release, stating 

that you will be filing Quo Warranto action. This is a Ceize and Desist 

letter, demanding that you do not use my pleadings and confidential 

information in any way, shape or f()fJTI, as you received those in elTor 

without my authorization. 

Additionally, I received information from a licensed Private 
investigator, with 20 years of experience with Scotland Yard and 12 years 
of experience in US, that your paralegal Lisa Liberi has an extensive 
criminal record, involving fraud, forgery ofdocuments and identity theft. 
See attached file. I also received infonnation that her husband, who is 
currently on parole, is an owner of2 ofaccounts, accepting credit cards on 
your charitable foundation web site. As an officer ofthe court I am 
obligated to forward this information to the authorities: FBI, Attorney 
General ofCalifornia and San Bernardino County Distict Attorney, since 
Lisa Liberi had a 8 year conviction in San Bernardino County, California. 
I believe that you, as an officer of the court, as well and a former Assitant 
Attorney General ofPennsylvania, should join me in issuing a joint 
complaint and demand for investigation from the above listed authorities. 
Dr. Orly Taitz Esq"

58. It should be noted, Berg does not have a charitable foundation website. He does 

~ 

-

have a website with a donation button which allows people to donate one (1) of two 

(2) ways, PayPal or by a separate credit card company, which Berg is the only party 

with access. 


59. Moreover, Liberi has nothing to do with the web mastering of his (Berg's) 
website, Taitz website or any other website. The coding for the donate buttons and 
the accounts which donations go into are all done by a third party webmaster and is 
all traceable. 
60. Berg never received the "supposed" Quo WalTanto Taitz is refelTing to above, nor 
has he seen it. However, what Liberi received from Allan Edward Buck, was a Writ 
of Mandamus and a Writ of Quo Warranto that he himselfhad drafted and did all the 
work on. If this is what Taitz is spreading around, it is not her work, but yet the work 
of another party. 
61. Plaintiffs then learned Orly Taitz had people go onto among others, Berg's 
website at obamacrimes.com, download all the briefs investigated and prepared by 
Berg and his assistant, copy the contents and Taitz then filed the briefs in Court 
claiming the work to be hers, again whieh is plagiarism of Berg's and his assistant's 
work, which is owned by the Law Offices of Philip J. Berg. 
62. On or about April 14, 2009, Liberi received an e-mail from a third party that 
contained a post on Plains Radio owned by Mr. and Mrs. Hale7โข The post was made 
by Defendant Katy and states she received an e-mail from Taitz stating the following. 
This same e-mail was also sent to an unknown number of undisclosed recipients: 


Dr. Orly's site has been taken over by Obots!! E-mail from Orly 
'This is an e-mail I recieved from her this afternoon: 
Katy" 
"This is a nightmare. I had hacking into my PayPal account. (see dossier #5 in 


attachment), the e-mail address on my PayPaJ account was changed, sol would not be 
able to get donations. It was reported by a number of donors and I have filed a complaint 
with the FBI. My blog was set up by a volunteer Lisa Ostella. She is the web master and 




:o;hc has the codes for the blog. She demanded that [ take back my complaint to FBI, 
claiming that the change of e-mail address was done by a volunteer by name Fran, that 
she banned Fran from the site, that it took care of the problem and [ need to take back my 
complaint of hacking with FB\. as it gives her. as a web master a bad name. I refused 
to do so, stating that it is a legitimate complainl, I want them to investigate. At that time 
she stated that I will need to get my blog of her server, if [ don't take back the FBI 
complaint. 

r found somebody else to host the blog, however according to volunteers she never 
forwarded the release and the codes to the platfonn company Go Daddy, she locked me 
out of my own foundation site and refuses to give me the access codes. She has posted a 
defamatory statement, claiming that rauthorized hacking into my own account and that I 
made bogus claims. This is totally ridiculous in light of the fact that I have statements 
from the donors and I lost donations. The FBI agent in charge of this investigation is 
Nathan Le, Orange county. CA, FBI, cyber crimes unit, phone 714-245-5328; 310-7103459.

63. Again, Taitz was aware all this information was false. Ostella is a Webmaster by 

trade, Taitz was maliciously slandering and posting libel about Ostella to punish and 

harm Ostella for telling the truth, which has effected Ostella's company, Go Excel 

Global. 

64. On or about April 17, 2009 at approximately 9:31 a.m. Taitz sent out a mass e-

mailing of slander and libel pertaining to Liberi, Ostella, Berg and the Law Offices of 

Philip .r. Berg. Liberi received an e-mail which contained Taitz Dossier No. Six (6) 

which was nothing more than a vicious attack on Ostella and Liberi. Taitz fabricated 

false allegations about both Ostella and Liberi. Taitz, gave personal identifying 

information regarding Liberi including her entire Social Security. Taitz made many 

false statements including but not limitt:d to the following: Ostella locked Taitz out of 

her website instead of transferring the access codes and domains; Ostella posted 

I:\FORMS\Liberi. Berg, Law Offices of PJB, Adams and Ostella Complaint for Damages 


bizarre defamatory statements that Taitz authorized hacking into her own account; 

Taitz claimed she received reports that some defamatory comments were made under 
alias usual1y used by Lisa Liberi, assistant for Attorney Philip J. Berg; Taitz 
insinuated Ostella was taking monies donated to her; Liberi had an extensive criminal 
record going back to 1990; Liberi, among other things. engaged in falsification of 
police reports, manipulation of credit bureau reports; counterfeiting of court 
documents; Liberi had Twenty-One Thousand [$21,000] Dollars per month in 
restitution; several sources confinned that Liberi lives in N M; they confirmed her 
date of birth and appearance as matching the ones on file with the San Bernardino, 
CA district attorney; Libert launched vicious attacks against Taitz and then states 
Liberi disagreed with her and this was the vicious attack. The list goes on. Dossier 
No.6 by Taitz own admission was an open letter posted on the internet and forwarded 
to 26,000 outlets of US and international media. In addition, Taitz sent this e-maiJ to 
an unknown number of undisclosed recipients asking them to post the information on 
their website. Again, included in this was Liberi's full Social Security number that 
Taitz obtained without a permissible purpose from Defendants, Neil Sankey, The 
Sankey Finn and Sankey Investigations, Inc. Moreover, Taitz sent this Dossier No.6 
to Attnrney General Eric Holder; Solicitor General Elena Kagan; Director of FBI 
Robelt Mueller; FBI Cyber Crime division, Orange County CA. Officer Nathan Le; 
Director of Secret Service Mark Sullivan; Chief of Security of the Supreme Court, 
Officer Christine Giaccio; Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts; and 
Legal Counsel to the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen, Captain 
Crawford. Taitz was well aware this information was false, and it was illegal to 
transmit a third (3fd) pa1ties personal identifying infOimation, including their Social 


Security number which Taitz had absolutely no permissible purpose to obtain; 

distribute via the internet, bye-mail and posting a person's private confidential 

information on wcbsites. A copy of Taitz Dossier No.6 will be provided to the 

Court; with a request that it be placed "u"del' ~;eal". Taitz also posted this on her 

website at Defend our Freedoms.s Below is only one of the many e-mails Taitz sent 

on this date

65. April 13,2009, Taitz was on a blog talk radio station, The Dame Truth9, which is 
an internet blog talk radio program. The entire time Taitz was on the air she did 
nothing but slander Liberi with the above referenced information. 
66. Taitz then posted on her website Defend our Freedoms: 1o "More on Lisa Liberi,

allowed to be anywhere near other people's credit cards, By Orlytaitz April 17,2009" 
67. On April 18,2009, Taitz posted further slander and libel about Ostel1a and Liberi, 
on her website, Defend our Freedoms II:

"Every day I get such receipts, showing that my former web master Lisa Ostella 
(posts under name Calpernia) has redirected donations to herself, to her e-mail 
address. Currently, as this was uncovered, she created new web sites Defend

to myoid ones and using the foundation name to steal more donations. She 
created a visa donation site with her e-mail account Go Excell Global,

and I closed the Pay Pal account completely. Any person, whose donations were 
stolen by Lisa Ostella aka Lisa Current aka Calpernia is asked to report this to 
his local police or sheriff's department. As I found out, she appears to be 
connected to Lisa Liberi, who is still working for attorney Phillip Berg. Please see 
my dossier #6, Lisa Liberi aka Lisa Richardson aka Lisa Courvelle has a long 
criminal record, that includes grand theft, forgery of documents, forgery of seal, 
falsification of police reports and credit statements, where financial institutions 
were defrauded out of thousands of dollars. She claims to be a different Lisa 
Uberi, living in PA, however she lives in NM and her probation officers are 
Joanne Martinez 505-827-8627 and Dawn Helling (not sure about spelling) 505476-
2359." 


68. Taitz then set-up another blogl2 where she was slandering and posting libel about 

Ostella. Taitz set up the blog, orlytaitz.com and posted the following: 


. 
Don't be fooled 

"My former web master Lisa Ostella has created an account that she called Defend Our 
Freedoms Network and is soliciting donations, praying on unsuspecting readers that 
would not notice the difference between Defend Our Freedoms Foundation and Defend 
Our Freedoms Community. Please notice, your donations there will not go to the 
foundation, they will go to her personal bank account. connected to her personal e-mail

access codes for the domains and the e-mail address list of the readers and stop 
fraudulently operating under the name DefendOurFreedoms and stop drawing financial 
profit from the Defend Our Freedoms name. I have also sent a Cease and Desist letter to 
Evelyn Adams aka Momma E, talk show host David Levin and other parties who are 
fraudulently advertising on the foundation website and drawing profit from it or from 
reader lists given or sold to them by Ms. Ostella. Ironically Ms. Ostella has accused me of 
collecting information on the readers. In reality I did not have any such information and 
could not reach most of the readers, aside from ones whose names were in my 
9LJi:.it:;;(c!{.l.3.tI99:..Qprne-mail account. Ms. Lisa Ostella is the one, who collected names 
and e-mail addresses and she is currently fraudulently sending e-mails to these readers 
using DefendOurFreedoms name. If you get such e-mail. please demand that she 
immediately stop this practice and forward the list to me. as the president of the 
foundation. 
My primary goal is to expose all the fraud committed by Obama and removing him out of 
office as an usurper, litigation against Ms. Ostella is secondary. I also need to get full 
information in regards to full damage to the foundation and me, stemming from actions of 
Ms. Ostella and parties that patronage her site and are aiding and abetting her. 
I, also, sent an e-mail withdossier#6toMr.Phil Berg, advising him of lengthy criminal 
record of grand theft, forgery, forgery of seal and other related crimes, committed by Ms. 
Lisa Liberi, his paralegal and assistant, who reportedly was managing his fund raising 
efforts. I believe Mr. Berg should not be using a person with such past in his fund raising 
efforts and legal practice and should issue a statement advising the donors and 
supporters, that Ms. Lisa Liberi is no longer employed by him or his foundation and that 
he is reviewing all donations and all legal records handled by Ms. Lisa Liberi. I believe the 

donors to Mr. Berg foundation should get assurances that their donations were used for 
litigation and the cause and not to reimburse victims of Ms. Liberi's prior 
schemes, reported to add to $21,000 per month.

requesting the posting of the infonnation along with her requests for everyone out 
there to contact the FBI, the Orange County Sheriff's Department, a probation officer 
in Santa Fe, New Mexico and report this infom1ation. It was nothing more than 
harassment of Liberi, Ostella, Berg and the Law Oftlces of Philip J. Berg.

date of birth, residcncy, ctc. to in excess of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand

against endangering, harassing, threatening and attempting to destroy any person's 
life and/or reputation. 

75. Despite knowing these very laws, Sankey through his investigation finns, the 
Sankey Finn and Sankey Investigations, Inc. conspired with Taitz to destroy Liberi 
and violated every privacy protection law; State and Federal laws for the disclosure, 
posting, and transmitting a person's Social Security number and personal identifying 
infonnation; and violated the permissible purpose rule. In so doing, Sankey through 
his investigation finns, the Sankey Firm and Sankey Investigations, Inc. just to

that Liberi had a long criminal record going back to the 90's and Liberi had been 
convicted of among other things, real estate fraud, falsification of police reports, 
manipulation of credit burcau reports, and counterfeiting of documents, which is 
completely false. Without bothering to investigate thc information sent by Linda, 
Neil Sankey through his finns, the Sankey Finn and Sankey Investigations, Inc. sent 
an e-mail out with the false information as if it were true. Since this e-mail was sent 
Neil Sankey admitted to two [2] separate individuals that he did not investigation the 
infonnation and could not verify it was in fact Liberi. See below.

Lisa Liberi, aka Lisa Richardson, 42, New Mexico, was sentenced in connection 
with felony charges involving identity theft and forged > documents. Liberi 
appeared in San Bernardino County. Rancho Cucamonga, Superior Court, on 
March 21,2008. She was sentenced to a state prison term of 8 years, imposed but

In 2002, San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department personnel arrested> Liberi 
on theft by false pretense charges. In July 2004. Investigators from the San 
Bernardino County District Attorney's Real Estate Fraud Unit arrested Liberi at 
the Ontario International Airport f()r additional felony charges while she was out 
on bail. 

She has an extensive criminal record going back to the 90's.

firms "The Sankey Film" and "Sankey Investigations" sent the information to Taitz 

and a repmier with World Net Daily via e-mail along with Liberi's full social security 

number, date of birth and where she resided. Also included, was Liberi's private 

confidential information. 

78. Sankey sent false and incorrect intormation claiming it to be associated with

79. Sankey through his investigation finns, the Sankey Finn and Sankey 

Investigations, Inc., did not have a pennissible purpose to obtain Liberi's Social 

Security number or any other personal identifying infonnation of tiberi. 

80. Moreover, Taitz did not have a pe1l11issible purpose to obtain or receive Liberi's 

Social Security number and personal identifying infonnation. This was nothing more 

than a complete l1bellslander and invasion of privacy not to mention it violated state 

and federal laws. 


81. Furthelmore, Sankey through his investigation finns, the Sankey Finn and Sankey 
Investigations, lnc., did not have any permissible purpose to disclose Liberi's Social 
Security number to any third parties including a Reporter with World Net Daily. 
82. In so doing, Sankey through his investigation fimls, the Sankey Finn and Sankey 
Investigations, Inc., have severely endangered Liberi, her son and husband. Liberi 
was given a confidential address as a result of her and her son be.ing victims of 
domestic violence. Sankey, through his investigation finns, the Sankey Finn and 
Sankey Investigations, Inc., have now disclosed Liberi's private personal information, 
full Social Security number, date of hirth and where she lives and has allowed said 
infonnation to be posted all over the internet hy Taitz and sent across the United 
States and Internationally, by Taitz own admission. 
83. Sankey through his investigation finns, the Sankey Finn and Sankey 
Investigations, Inc., conspired with Taitz to ensure Liberi's Hfe was endangered and 
ruined. Sankey was well aware ofTaitz threat to destroy Liberi to get to Berg and his 
law practice. 
84. Sankey through his investigations finns, the Sankey Firm and Sankey 
Investigations, Inc., had a duty to abide by the California privacy Jaws. Because 
Sankey through his investigation finns, the Sankey Finn and Sankey Investigations, 
Inc., failed to ensure Taitz had a permissible purpose, which she did not, the fact 
Sankey himself distributed Liberi's Social Security number and private personal 
identifying infonnation through e-mail to a Reporter and Taitz, since Sankey and his 
investigation firms failed to ensure and sign a contract with Taitz and the Reporter 
with World Net Daily to ensure the confidentiality of Liberi's Social Security 



number, date of birth, and other private personal identifying infonnation, he is liable

but my affiliation with Obamacrimes.com and Phil J Berg has 
come to a unhappy parting of the ways. I cannot abide the 
lies, false accusations and trashing of me when I discovered 
some less than honest dealings were going on. One lie after

Maybe in a few days I will be able to talk about if,

the betrayal of me after a 10 + year friendship was ended 
tonight, where Phil was not even willing to listen to me or even 
tell me what it is I am supposed to have done, this time. I will

As you've probably noticed, there have been changes to the OC Board 
discussions lately. Everything from additional Agents, to subtraction of 
Agents and members, to Obots being allowed back to the board and to 
be placed into positions of trust as Moderators/Agents. A lot has been 
going on behind the scenes, as well as on the OC board itself. 
I'm sure you're not happy with what's going on. We aren't, either. It's 
counter productive to having discussions, when you're busy rehashing 6 
month-old arguments with people who are purposely derailing every 
discussion. So a group of us got together, including former 
Moderators/ Agents, and decided it was time to do our own thing. 
We've decided to create our own board. It will be an atmosphere that is 
Obot-FREE. Our core group want nothing more than Justice for the 
usurper in our Office. We can have flowing discussion, like we had 
before the changes at OC. Also, there may be some pleasant surprises in 
store, on the new board. Surprises that will definitely be a HUGE benefit 
for this cause. We aren't limiting ourselves to discussions of anyone 
attorney or effort. We want to raise public awareness of all the efforts 
to expose the truth and remove the Usurper from office. 


We'd like to have you join us at our new site, if you are interested in 
truth and justice. Please invite others to join, but only invite those who 
you're SURE are with US, not THEM. This will ensure progress in our daily 
discussions. We are implementing a screening process to insure only like 
minded individuals are accepted into our ranks. Welcome to our friends. 


Thanks.

mailed-by 

Lisa, below is the e-mail Linda sent to Amboy Duke, the guy she thinks is 


Ted Nudgent. Amboy Duke is not Ted Nugent but someone from another 
blog. 

Thank you for responding. I am glad to hear from you again. I was 
beginning to think you got frustrated and quit. I have a new effort 
and site that is very exciting to a lot of people who are following me, 
having gotten disgusted with Phil. 

We just got the new site up and plan to raise public awareness for 
all the cases. This way I have not publicly gone against Phil, whose 
efforts I truly do not want to harm, or diminish his chances to win 
any of his cases. He deserves credit for all his hard work when he 
was the only one willing to take action and the first to file suit. He 
has worked tirelessly, but unfortunately, he won't win because there 
is a serious problem with Lisa and Barry's people are going to hurl it 
out in the court and that'll be it for all the cases. 

Berg supporters know something very bad happened to make me 
leave (which it did), but I do not intend to make it a public issue. 
Many of them did and a lot of people left and convinced me to do 
my own campaign and are following me now. It's because I was 
accused of terrible things by Lisa that are simply not true and I 
defended myself, but only with a handful of people. Phil believed 
her and I was forced out. Then he wrote me another nasty e-mail 
basically trying to intimidate me into silence about Lisa, which 
wasn't necessary because I wasn't the one who exposed her issues 
as I was accused of doing. I didn't even know it, but she has some 
major credibility problems that I don't want to get into. 

We believe our time is better spent raising public awareness for the 
efforts of everyone. Phil shouldn't be slamming Orly Taitz just 
because she's making a lot of noise and getting a lot of attention. I 
told him not to be slamming her, but now that I'm forced out, he is 
listening to Lisa. It looks like sour grapes. My role was both 
cheerleader and attack dog since I could do that as a volunteer. 

Lisa has allowed trolls to take over and even become moderators. I 
don't know if she's getting blackmailed by them or what, but it's a 
very toxic environment and people just don't want to be there, and 
that includes financial supporters who wonder now how their 
donations have been spent. It got so bad that you saw the results 
when you kept asking questions. And it's was never that way 
before. Posters welcomed the chance to answer questions. My site 
will be like that and we will have a section that isn't up yet, to list the 
facts and answer most of the pertinent questions. You will be able 
to go to one place and get answers without having to sort through 
1000's of blogger posts. 


I used to be a guest on a lot of radio shows talking about my 
findings exposing various scandals and crimes. I am going to start 
doing that again to reach a larger audience. Me and the others who 
came with me to start this new effort feel that if we can raise the 
public awareness to a level that 100 million people are demanding 
Barry produce the proof, or that the DOJ arrest and remove him to 
prosecute for all his many crimes in illegally usurping office as 
POTUS. 

My efforts will not conflict with Phil's, but I feel compelled to say, 
please don't get involved with him. I no longer trust Phil or his 
Judgment after he was willing to listen to outright lies about me 
made by Lisa. You don't throw someone under the bus after being 
friends for more than 10 years, especially not your main 
cheerleader who fires people up to support the cause. Like I said 
before, this is no catfight. It's a major integrity issue. Lisa is a 
pathological liar and it really pains me to say that, but it's true. I 
can't, in good conscience, possibly recommend you get involved 
with Phil after what I learned. I don't want to say more in writing. 

In answer to your second e-mail, no one contacted me on your 
behalf. And if someone does, I will answer their questions in detail. 
I have enough knowledge to do that and speak coherently on the 
subject. In fact, I have been dOing that all along except for a few 
legal questions. Now I know the answers so we don't necessarily 
need anyone else to answer. I am raising funds to wage a media 
campaign to raise public awareness, buying media ads and such. 
And if you decide to help us, you will know exactly what we are 
doing. My site is moving to another server today that is a better 
place for our bloggers and security. My site is going to be bigger 
than Phil's because a lot of the supporters who had another favorite 
and scattered when their efforts failed, will join me and we'll support 
them ALL 

I look forward to speaking to you or someone on your behalf soon.

t02. On March 7, 2009, Linda caned the otlice and left a message for Berg stating 
"Lisa is sending vial things out about me, she is bad mouthing me, she is deleting my 
e-mail to you and she sent me e-mails admitting it." Knowing the entire time these 
were alllics and fabricated stories. 

103. Linda called Berg and told him his Liberi had a criminal record and was stealing 
Twelve Thousand [$12,000.00] Dollars per month from Berg's PayPal account and 
was sending "vial" things around the internet about Linda. Linda went on further 
stating Liberi had a criminal record going all the way back to the 1990's, all of which 
Linda knew was false. Berg told Linda to send him an e-mail with all these e-mails 
attached. Berg thcn called Liberi and asked for the same thing. Liberi sent Berg 
thirty-seven [37] pages. Linda sent nothing. 
104. As time went on, Berg sent e-mails to Linda asking for her list. Berg finally 
received another nasty e-mail about Lisa stating Lisa didn't like what Linda had sent 
on Thursday so Lisa deleted it. Berg asked Linda numerous times to resend the 
"supposed" e-mail, Berg never received anything. Instead, Linda blocked Berg's email 
address. 
105. Linda sent the same accusations outlined above via e-mail to a private 
investigator named Neil Sankey with The Sankey Finn and Sankey Investigations, 
Inc. Instead of investigating the information Sankey e-mailed the infonnation along 
with Liberi's Social Security number, date of birth and where she lived to a Reporter 
at World Net Daily and to Orty Taitz. [see above under "Factual Allegations 
pertaining to Orly Taitz, et al" and Factual Allegations pertaining to Sankey, et a1."] 


1 06. Linda's behaviors continued and she then began contacting moderators on Berg's 
website blog. Linda was attempting to lure all of Berg's moderators over to her new 


website. Linda was also attempting to steal Berg's supporters. It was later 
discovered Linda was in fact the individual with an extensive criminal record dating 
back to ] 992 through 2007 for Theft, Fraud, and Fraud by Check, etc., according to 
the Texas Depmiment of Public Safety and according to a criminal background check 
run on her by her Social Security number.
