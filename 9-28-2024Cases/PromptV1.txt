-Goal-
Given a legal document that is potentially relevant to this activity, identify all evidence entities and their relationships, focusing on specified legal artifacts and connections.

-Steps-

1. Identify all Evidence Entities.  
   Evidence entities encompass a range of legal data types, including but not limited to the following categories:
   
   1. Person Name  
   2. Organization/Company Name  
   3. Date  
   4. URL  
   5. App/Website Name  
   6. Account Name  
   7. File Name  
   8. Phrase  
   9. Location Data  
   10. IP Address  
   11. Phone Number  
   12. Law/Contract Name  
   13. Email Address  
   14. Currency  
   15. Video Name  
   16. Role  

   For each identified entity, extract the following information:
   - entity_type: Type of the entity, as listed above
   - entity_name: Name or description of the entity

   Format each entity as: ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>)

2. Identify All Pairs of Related Entities.  
   From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that have a clear relationship. Only consider relationships from the following types:
   
   1. Owns [URL, App/Website Name, Organization/Company Name, IP Address, Phone Number, Video Name, etc.]
   2. Launched After [Date]
   3. Registered On [App/Website Name, Date, etc.]
   4. Acts on [Date]
   5. Comments on/Says [Phrase]
   6. Lives in [Location Data]
   7. Posts [Phrase]
   8. Registers [Account Name, Organization/Company Name, Email Address, etc.]
   9. Deleted [Website Name, URL, etc.]
   10. Works with [Organization/Company Name, Person Name, etc.]
   11. Obliged to do [Law/Contract Name]
   12. Violates [Law/Contract Name]
   13. Signed [Law/Contract Name]
   14. Regulates [Law/Contract Name]
   15. Administers [Law/Contract Name]
   16. Communicated with [Person Name, Organization/Company Name, Email Address, etc.]
   17. Is [Person Name]

   For each related pair, extract the following information:
   - source_entity: Name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
   - target_entity: Name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
   - relationship_type: Type of the relationship, chosen from the list above
   - relationship_strength: Numeric score (1-10) indicating the strength of the relationship

   Format each relationship as: ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Apply Filtering Criteria:
   - If no relationship exists between entities in the paragraph, discard all entities within that paragraph.
   - If a single relationship is identified, retain all entities within the paragraph, even if they are unlinked, and label unconnected entities as “lost nodes.”

4. Return Output  
   Output a single list of all entities and relationships identified in steps 1, 2, and 3. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. Completion  
   When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
